# Chapter 8

### Exercise 8.1

The nonplanning method looks particularly poor in Figure 8.3 because it is
a one-step method; a method using multi-step bootstrapping would do better. Do you

the Dyna method? Explain why or why not.

#### Answer

n-step TD with n high enough to cover optimal path from starting point to terminate state.
